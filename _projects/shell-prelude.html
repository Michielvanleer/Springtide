subtitle: In depth analysis to make sure installation of Shell prelude was done without harming the enviroment.
quote: "The in depth analysis was a client requirement to understand the impact of installing the Shell Prelude and to take appropiate measures before the actual positioning"
challenge: The Shell Prelude was to be installed in an area which is known for its Marine Wildlife but also for its harsh environment. As this is a high level project in terms of cost, media-attention and operational risk. Shell wanted to understand what the impact of the operation would be for the environment in the preparation, sail-away, positioning, operation and de-installation and sail-away.
my-solution: a detailed enviromental risk assessment was being initiated with consultation groups of each section of the project.
the-result: the outcome of the risk assessment was shared with the project-team and in seperate meetings, appropiate measures were taken and communicated. This included selecting green vessels to assist and sourcing tankers with green label. Monitoring systems for bottom, air and water have been sourced.
keystats: 150 man hours, 350t co2 reduction, 7 meetings, 350 key hazards defined.
testimonial:
Springtide was sourced after an extensive three bid process and we got what we wanted and more.
We are impressed by his capabillity to adapt to our culture and understand the objectives of the project and his abillity to connect with all share-holders.
